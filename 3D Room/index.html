          Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
          The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
          differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for
          the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or
          vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because
          they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some
          may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who
          are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who
          do. <br />
